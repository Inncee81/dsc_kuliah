<h3>Most People Never Master English…</h3>
<p>If you are reading this page, then we know that your English reading skills are ok. But when it comes to actually <span class="lp-italic">speaking</span> English, well, that’s another story!</p>
<p>You have probably been studying English for years, and yet, you still feel nervous, embarrassed, or self-conscious about speaking English. Perhaps you must speak slowly, and you have difficulty finding the right words to communicate. Maybe speaking good English feels like a chore. Maybe you make simple grammar mistakes that make you feel foolish. People shouldn’t judge your intelligence based on your English speaking skills, but unfortunately… <span class="lp-italic">they do</span>.</p>
<p>You might even feel like you are <span class="lp-underline">too old to ever master English</span> or any other language. We’re here to tell you that nothing could be further from the truth! Anyone can become fluent in English — at any age — you simply need to find a system that makes learning as easy as possible.</p>

<p>“I am so excited because in after a I bought the TS lessons (I thought on June 17,2015) <strong>I really feel 200% more confident when speaking.</strong> I live in PR as you may know my native language is Spanish, but my job requires a lot of English, I am an Assistant Vice President in a financial institution and all kind of regulations and procedures still in English, and there are many providers from the states in touch with us here in PR. I can communicate without fear and I am not shy at all like weeks before.<br>
This is a humble way to say THANK YOU guys you are doing awesome.”</p>

<h5>PhD student and researcher – Iran</h5>
<div class="name-border"></div>
<p>“I am a visiting student in Harvard university and I’ve been in many English classes during my life. One day I saw deep English.com and started with free courses and I just felt amazing! It was the most enjoyable English course in my whole life! Everyday it mentioned points that were exactly what I needed, it made me more eager for learning. After a short time <strong>I felt confidence I could speak with native people</strong> without embarrassing and thinking about mistakes. Thank you deep english. Com”</p>

<h3>Stop Studying and Start Using English</h3>
<h3>You Learn By <span class="lp-italic">Doing</span>.</h3>
<p>If you want to become a better speaker, you need to speak more. And if you want to become a better listener, you need to listen more. This is something that even teachers don’t know. They want you to learn by memorizing. They want you to learn by studying grammar rules. You won’t become fluent by studying rules. You must practice speaking and listening.</p>
<p>Now, there are a select few “name brand” English courses that will help you practice speaking and listening. They are effective, however most of them come with one big flaw…</p>
<p>Studies have shown that fewer than 10% of people will read a book past the first chapter. This is the same for English courses. Most people start English courses that they will never finish. Have you ever wondered why it is so difficult to actually finish an entire English course?</p>
<p>The answer is simple:</p>
<h3>Most English Courses are Boring!</h3>
<h3>There is a better way to learn…</h3>
<p>There are many English courses and programs out there, but these lessons come with major problems.</p>
<p>Many are filled with English that is for beginners or English that you will never use in the real world. Most of them make you spend hours and hours memorizing grammar rules and looking at flash cards, but they don’t give you a way to practice your speaking and your listening. So what happens? You get bored with the material. Deep down, you know that you won’t use most of what you are learning, and it kills your motivation.</p>
<p>How can you be expected to learn fluent English from a <span class="lp-italic">boring</span> English course? If you give up on an English textbook because it cannot hold your attention, <strong>it’s not your fault</strong>.</p>

<h3>How Do We Make Our Lessons Interesting?</h3>
<p>Our English lessons are made up of twelve of the <span class="lp-underline">most interesting stories ever told</span>.</p>
<p style="font-size:22px;text-align:center;"><span class="lp-italic">For example…</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lesson Pack #1 asks:</strong> <span class="lp-italic">how far would you go to save your own life?</span> And then you hear a story about a man who <span class="lp-underline">chopped off his own arm</span> to save his life…</li>
<li><strong>Lesson Pack #6</strong> is about a man who joined a pack of wolves, became their leader, then <span class="lp-underline">lived, ate, slept, and hunted</span> alongside them for 2 years.</li>
<li><strong>Lesson Pack #3</strong> reveals the unbelievable truth about slavery in the 21st century. You hear about a boy who recently escaped and <span class="lp-underline">freed thousands of other slaves</span>.</li>
<li><strong>In Lesson Pack #5</strong>, you hear the incredible story about a man who  survived the atomic bombings of both Hiroshima and Nagasaki.</li>
<li><strong>Lesson Pack #4</strong> tells the story of an American city which was <span class="lp-underline">evacuated</span> due to an alien invasion. (100% true!)</li>
</ul>
<p>And the best part is these lessons don’t only train you to understand real English, they give you a way to practice your English speaking even if you live in a place without anyone to practice speaking with.</p>

I bought your True Stories course and I was very grateful because the topics are very interesting and easy to remember and they helped to increase my confidence in speaking. <strong>After only 1 month I have improved significantly my English.</strong>“</p>
